= TPCFIX
Malte Dehling <mdehling@gmail.com>


When files are copied from a UNIX, Windows, or other non-VMS system to a VMS
system, they are usually stored in a 512 byte fixed size record structure.
`TPCFIX` is a program to restore the natural variable size record structure of
TPC format tape archives on (Micro)VMS.  This is required, e.g., to allow
writing such an archive back to a physical tape using `VMSTPC`.

To build `TPCFIX`, run the `BUILD.COM` command procedure as follows:

----
$ @BUILD
Compiling...
Linking...
----

Next, define a foreign command for `TPCFIX`:

----
$ TPCFIX :== $$DISK:[LOCATION]TPCFIX.EXE
----

You may now run `TPCFIX` as follows:

----
$ TPCFIX input.tpc output.tpc
----

Given a 512b fixed record size file `input.tpc`, this should produce
a file `output.tpc` of variable record size.

`TPCFIX` was compiled and tested on a VAXstation 2000 with TK50Z tape drive
running MicroVMS v4.7 with VAX-C v2.3.
